## ðŸ”§ Configuration Notes

- **Network Mode**: Both VMs used `Host-Only Adapter` (or same NAT network) to enable local communication.
- **Capture Interface**: Wireshark on Kali was set to listen on the correct interface (e.g., `eth0` or `enp0s3`) that bridges the two VMs.
- **Login Simulation**: User credentials were typed into the Windows VM's login form while Wireshark was capturing packets.
